# CNN-based-Thyroid-Classification
### Thyroid Nodule Classification System  This system uses a quantum-inspired convolutional neural network to enhance the detection and classification of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images. It effectively differentiates between benign and malignant nodules, outperforming traditional methods and accelerating thyroid cancer diagnosis.
