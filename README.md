Quantum Filter based CNN for Improved Thyroid Nodule Classification 
  This system uses a quantum-inspired convolutional neural network to enhance the detection and classification of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images. It effectively differentiates between benign and malignant nodules, outperforming traditional methods and accelerating thyroid cancer diagnosis. Improved the accuracy from 92% to 98.59%.
